            <p>Consider hiding the status bar - and all other app UI - while people are actively viewing full-screen media. if you hide the status bar, be sure to let people retrieve it and the appropriate app ui with a single tap. unless you have a compelling reason to do so, avoid defining a custom gesture to redisplay the status bar because users are unlikely to discover such a gesture or to remember it.
